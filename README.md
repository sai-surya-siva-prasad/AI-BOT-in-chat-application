Name of the Project: Chat App with the NEW ChatGPT API

Description: I created a chat application integrating ChatEngine and OpenAI's ChatGPT. For the frontend, I used ChatEngine to handle the chat functionality, Redux Toolkit for state management, Redux Toolkit Query for making API calls, Hero icons for the user interface, and React Router for navigation. For the backend, I utilized Node.js as the runtime, Express.js as the framework, and OpenAI for AI integration with the chat. The end result was a chat application that allows users to interact with ChatGPT.

Technologies I Used:

Frontend: ChatEngine, Redux Toolkit, Redux Toolkit Query, Hero icons, React Router
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, OpenAI


What I Learned: The project provided me with a comprehensive understanding
of how to integrate ChatGPT with a chat application. I learned how 
to set up the frontend and backend, including the installation of necessary packages. I set up the main chat application using React Chat Engine, created a custom chat header and message form, and understood the role of OpenAI and its relation to ChatGPT. I also delved into AI chat, AI code, AI assist, and implemented authentication and authorization. This project allowed me to build a complete full-stack chat application from scratch.
